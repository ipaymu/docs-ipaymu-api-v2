To ensure the security of transactions, iPaymu implements strict validation for IP addresses and Domains, especially in the **Production/Live** environment.

<Callout type="warn" title="Production Requirement">
  In Production mode, your server's IP address and the domain used in the request body MUST be
  registered and validated by iPaymu. Failure to do so will result in an `Invalid IP` or `Invalid
  Domain` error.
</Callout>

## IP Address Validation

iPaymu requires your server to use a **Static IP**. Dynamic IPs can change, leading to transaction failures.

### Why Static IP?

- **Security**: Ensures requests only come from authorized servers.
- **Stability**: Prevents service interruptions caused by IP changes.

If your server uses a dynamic IP, please contact your hosting provider to request a Static IP. Once obtained, you may need to whitelist it in your iPaymu dashboard or contact support.

## Domain Validation

When making requests to iPaymu (e.g., for `notifyUrl`, `returnUrl`, `cancelUrl`), the domain used must match the domain registered in your iPaymu account.

### Common Issues

- **Localhost**: You cannot use `localhost` URLs in Production.
- **Unregistered Subdomains**: Ensure subdomains are also allowed if you use them.
- **Protocol Mismatch**: Ensure you are using the correct protocol (`http` vs `https`) as registered.
