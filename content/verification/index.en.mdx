## Important Notes

### Domain & IP Validation

Ensure your website is ready. For further configuration regarding IP and domain whitelisting, you can access the Integration menu:

- **Domain Validation**: [Sandbox](https://sandbox.ipaymu.com/domain) / [Production](https://my.ipaymu.com/domain)
- **IP Validation**: [Sandbox](https://sandbox.ipaymu.com/ip) / [Production](https://my.ipaymu.com/ip)

<Callout type="tip" title="Static IP">
  It is recommended to use a **Static IP** for your server to ensure transaction security and
  stability. If you do not have a Static IP, please contact our support team at
  [support@ipaymu.com](mailto:support@ipaymu.com) to consult for alternative solutions.

### Common Errors

- **NIK less than 16 digits**: Ensure the NIK entered is exactly 16 numbers.
